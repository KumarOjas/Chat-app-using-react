# realtime-chat-app
Realtime chat app using socket.io and vanilla JavaScript



## Installation 
  Run `npm install` to install all the dependancies.
  Then run it on the local host. For that open the project in powershell and npm start it will open in local host. 
  I ran it on codesandbox.io to check the output which is an open idle.
